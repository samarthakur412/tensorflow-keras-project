# TensorFlow Keras API Project

## 📌 Overview

This project utilizes the **TensorFlow Keras API** to build and evaluate deep learning models for **loan default prediction** using data from LendingClub. The objective is to predict whether a borrower will default on a loan based on various financial and demographic features.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from **LendingClub**, comprising loan records with the following key features:

- **loan_amnt**: The loan amount requested by the borrower.
- **term**: The duration of the loan (e.g., 36 or 60 months).
- **int_rate**: The interest rate assigned to the loan.
- **installment**: The fixed monthly payment owed by the borrower.
- **grade**: LendingClub's assigned loan grade.
- **sub_grade**: A more granular loan grade.
- **emp_title**: The job title of the borrower.
- **emp_length**: The length of the borrower's employment.
- **home_ownership**: The borrower's home ownership status.
- **annual_inc**: The annual income of the borrower.
- **verification_status**: Indicates if the income was verified.
- **purpose**: The purpose of the loan (e.g., debt consolidation, credit card).
- **title**: The loan title provided by the borrower.
- **zip_code**: The first three digits of the borrower's zip code.
- **addr_state**: The state provided by the borrower in the loan application.
- **dti**: Debt-to-income ratio.
- **earliest_cr_line**: The date when the borrower's earliest reported credit line was opened.
- **open_acc**: The number of open credit lines in the borrower's credit file.
- **pub_rec**: The number of derogatory public records.
- **revol_bal**: The borrower's revolving balance.
- **revol_util**: The revolving line utilization rate.
- **total_acc**: The total number of credit lines currently in the borrower's credit file.
- **initial_list_status**: The initial listing status of the loan.
- **application_type**: Indicates whether the loan is an individual or joint application.
- **mort_acc**: The number of mortgage accounts.
- **pub_rec_bankruptcies**: The number of public record bankruptcies.
- **loan_status**: The target variable indicating if the loan was fully paid or charged off.

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and addressed missing data in columns like `emp_title`, `emp_length`, `title`, `mort_acc`, and `revol_util`.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and transformed existing ones, such as encoding categorical variables (`grade`, `sub_grade`, `home_ownership`, etc.) and extracting information from date fields.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed or adjusted irrelevant or redundant features to improve model performance.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Visualized distributions** of key features to understand data patterns.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examined relationships between features and the target variable (`loan_status`).
- **Handled Imbalanced Data**: Addressed any class imbalances in the target variable.

### 3. **Model Building**

- **Neural Network Architecture**: Designed a deep learning model using TensorFlow's Keras API with multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers.
- **Activation Functions**: Utilized activation functions like ReLU for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer.
- **Compilation**: Compiled the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers suitable for binary classification.

### 4. **Model Training and Evaluation**

- **Data Splitting**: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Training**: Trained the neural network on the training data with techniques like early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzed true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives to evaluate classification performance.
